## Overview

Kubernetes enables dynamic scaling of workloads, but efficiently scaling the underlying nodes remains a challenge. Workloads experience fluctuating demand, and without a responsive scaling mechanism, clusters either run out of capacity (leading to failed pod scheduling) or become inefficient (leading to underutilized nodes and unnecessary costs)
## Key Features

- **Out-of-the-box support for advanced spot orchestration** with on-demand fallback and reverse fallback.
- **Harness’ Pod Evictor**, paired with Karpenter’s consolidation, for efficient bin packing.
- **Dynamic spot/on-demand workload replica splitting** for better cost optimization.
- **Visibility into cost savings** generated by Cluster Orchestrator.
- **Commitment utilization guarantee** by integrating with Harness’s Commitment Orchestration to maximize reserved capacity.
