## Node Autoscaling Problem in Kubernetes

Kubernetes enables dynamic scaling of workloads, but efficiently scaling the underlying nodes remains a challenge. Workloads experience fluctuating demand, and without a responsive scaling mechanism, clusters either run out of capacity (leading to failed pod scheduling) or become inefficient (leading to underutilized nodes and unnecessary costs). The key challenges in Kubernetes node autoscaling include:

- **Slow reaction to demand surges:** Without automation, provisioning new nodes takes time, causing pod scheduling delays.
- **Over-provisioning or under-utilization:** Manually setting node counts leads to inefficiencies.
- **Cluster resource fragmentation:** Suboptimal node selection results in wasted resources.
- **Cost inefficiency:** Running excess nodes increases cloud costs without delivering proportional benefits.
