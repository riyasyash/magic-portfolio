         I enjoy building things that are thoughtful, reliable, and genuinely useful.
Whether it’s improving developer experience, scaling systems, or simplifying product workflows — I care deeply about the why behind every line of code.
I’m not just writing backend logic or frontend views — I’m helping shape products with empathy and clarity.
